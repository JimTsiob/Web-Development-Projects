# Library website

For this project we had to create three webpages that comprised a library website. We also learned some technologies that are used in web development such as Handlebars , nodejs , Fetch API and the express framework. Finally , we learned how to connect the website with an external database.

## First webpage (index.html)
the first webpage hosts the search bar , a menu to navigate through the other webpages and the button for searching

## Second webpage (manageFavBooks.html)
this webpage has the favorite books list , where the user can edit the book's title and author or delete books from the list.

## Third webpage (editBook.html)
this webpage is used to input the new title and author of a book and then add the new attributes to the database. Can also return back to previous page.
